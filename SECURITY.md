# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in ON1Builder, please report it by sending an email to security@example.com. Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly until they have been handled by the security team.

The security team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours, and will send a more detailed response within 72 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Security Checklist

### Vault and Secret Management

- [ ] Vault is properly initialized and unsealed
- [ ] Vault token is securely stored and rotated regularly (every 30 days)
- [ ] Secrets are stored in Vault, not in environment variables or configuration files
- [ ] Secrets are only accessed when needed, not stored in memory
- [ ] Vault audit logging is enabled
- [ ] Vault access policies are properly configured
- [ ] Vault is deployed in high-availability mode in production

**Important Note**: The deployment instructions in this repository use Vault in development mode for simplicity. In a real production environment, you should:

1. Deploy Vault in production mode with proper authentication and authorization
2. Use a proper storage backend (e.g., Consul, PostgreSQL, or S3)
3. Implement proper unsealing procedures (e.g., using Shamir's Secret Sharing or auto-unseal with a cloud KMS)
4. Enable audit logging
5. Configure proper access policies
6. Implement token rotation
7. Set up high availability

For more information, see the [Vault Production Hardening Guide](https://www.vaultproject.io/guides/operations/production).

## Security Best Practices

### Ethereum Wallet Security

1. **Use Hardware Wallets**: For production deployments, consider using hardware wallets or HSMs to store private keys.
2. **Separate Wallets**: Use separate wallets for different environments (development, staging, production).
3. **Minimal Funds**: Keep only the necessary funds in hot wallets.
4. **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit wallet transactions and balances.
5. **Multi-Signature**: Consider using multi-signature wallets for high-value operations.

### API Security

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
2. **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms.
3. **Authorization**: Implement proper authorization controls.
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all input parameters.
5. **Output Encoding**: Encode all output to prevent injection attacks.
6. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information.
7. **Logging**: Log security events without including sensitive information.
8. **Monitoring**: Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.

### Docker Security

1. **Minimal Base Images**: Use minimal base images to reduce attack surface.
2. **Non-Root User**: Run containers as non-root users.
3. **Read-Only Filesystem**: Use read-only filesystems where possible.
4. **Resource Limits**: Set resource limits to prevent DoS attacks.
5. **Security Scanning**: Scan images for vulnerabilities.
6. **Image Signing**: Sign and verify images.
7. **Network Policies**: Implement network policies to restrict traffic.
8. **Secrets Management**: Use secrets management solutions, not environment variables.

### Monitoring and Alerting

1. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Monitor all critical systems and services.
2. **Real-Time Alerting**: Configure alerts for security events.
3. **Log Aggregation**: Aggregate logs for analysis.
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Implement anomaly detection to identify suspicious activity.
5. **Incident Response**: Have an incident response plan in place.
6. **Regular Review**: Regularly review monitoring and alerting configurations.
7. **Testing**: Test monitoring and alerting regularly.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as needed. It is recommended to always use the latest version of ON1Builder to ensure you have the latest security fixes.
